            <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">The Problem</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">Crypto tokens became the worst part of the problem they sought to solve. "A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" *1 Why?</p>
            <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-4">
              <li className="mb-2">
                <strong>Usefulness:</strong> Most tokens don't answer the question, what is the token for? In general, they are issued to obtain resources, and this response does not work because the tokens become a kind of security or unregulated commodity, risky for both the issuer and the buyer. *2
              </li>
              <li className="mb-2">
                <strong>Volatility, Speculation, and Liquidity:</strong> Crypto Tokens are traded on a CEX (Centralized Exchange) where liquidity is not transparent or decentralized and the price is usually tied to everything that happens on the CEX (FTX can be cited as an example). The other way to trade Crypto Tokens is on a DEX (Decentralized Exchange); here, liquidity is transparent and decentralized, but always depends on a third party, and this creates two problems:
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-6">
                  <li>Normally the liquidity in the DEX does not represent the totality of the tokens issued.</li>
                  <li>The liquidity provider is unknown, and therefore the conflicts of interest that it may have with the token, so the price of a token is often synthetically inflated and then liquidity disappears.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li className="mb-2">
                <strong>Network Usage:</strong> The Blockchain is an immutable network of transactional registration and not of securities registration. *3
              </li>
            </ol>
          </section>

          <section className="mb-8">
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Our Solution</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">BTMs (Bidirectional Tokenization Model) are interchangeable assets linked to a brand, a company, a content creator, or any type of community with aligned incentives. They are custom assets that allow their holders to unlock interactions, specific experiences or simply invest in their favorite brands or people.</p>
            <p className="mb-4">BTMs exemplify the main spirit of how intermediaries should not be a necessary condition for value transfer. BTMs are a pathway to financial and creative independence for both brands and their community.</p>
            <p className="mb-4">The success of any brand or value creator comes from fostering growth of their community. With a BTM, as their community grows, a thriving economy is formed that rewards both the value creator and their community.</p>
            <p className="mb-4">This system allows bidirectional exchanges, so participants can buy and sell their tokens at any time without submitting to the risks of volatility, speculation, and liquidity that the Cryptocurrency Exchanges have, centralized (CEX) and/or decentralized (DEX). *4</p>
            <p className="mb-4">This is achieved by a mathematical model that facilitates the joining of a bonding curve with a fungible interlace. This combination creates an automated market model (AMM) that sets the price of one token relative to another and to supply.</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mb-4">
              <li>The weighted mathematical equation is a generalization of the constant product formula x ∗ y = k recommended for automated market makers (AMM).</li>
              <li>Generalization n ≥ 2 accounts for weights that are not a uniform division of 50/50. *5</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">A binding curve consists of a base token and a destination token:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mb-4">
              <li>The base token is the one with which we establish the price in relation.</li>
              <li>The target token is the new token created.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">*In general, the base token should have a reasonably high market capitalization, USDC, for example</p>
          </section>

          <section className="mb-8">
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Example</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">A simple example could be:</p>
            <p className="mb-4">P = 0.01</p>
            <p className="mb-4">This means that the Price when there is a Token in circulation is:</p>
            <p className="mb-4">0.01 * 1 = 0.01</p>
            <p className="mb-4">So when there are 100 Tokens in circulation the Price is:</p>
            <p className="mb-4">0.01 * 100 = 1</p>
            <p className="mb-4">When a destination token is purchased, the price in base tokens is left as a reserve. When a destination token is sold, it is burned, and the base tokens are returned from the reserve to the holder's wallet.</p>
          </section>

          <section className="mb-8">
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Advanced Example</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">What happens if you want to establish a relationship between the target supply and the reserve that is maintained? This is called:</p>
            <p className="mb-4">Invariable modeling, price cores and risk aversion. *6</p>
            <p className="mb-4">An example of binding curve with price P and supply S</p>
            <p className="mb-4">P = S<sup>0.5</sup></p>
            <p className="mb-4">You can define R, the number of base tokens stored in the reserves, as the area under the curve up to the current supply:</p>
            <p className="mb-4">Therefore, if you take the indefinite integral, you can say that the Reserve is:</p>
            <p className="mb-4">R = 0.666667S<sup>1.5</sup></p>
            <p className="mb-4">Now, what happens when base tokens are injected into the Reserve?</p>
            <p className="mb-4">This causes all holders to see an increase in the value of the token. Our previous formula does not take this possibility into account in pricing. So how is this model supported?</p>
            <p className="mb-4">Given the Reserve function.</p>
            <p className="mb-4">R = 0.666667S<sup>1.5</sup></p>
            <p className="mb-4">It is said that the reserve is always proportional to the offer in a relationship that should never change.</p>
            <p className="mb-4">0.666667S<sup>1.5</sup> / R</p>
            <p className="mb-4">Keeping this proportion unchanged, if the reserve is increased by an amount Δ *7</p>
            <p className="mb-4">ΔR, the increase in supply ΔS should maintain this formula:</p>
            <p className="mb-4">0.666667S<sup>1.5</sup> / R = 0.666667(S+ΔS)<sup>1.5</sup> / R+ΔR</p>
            <p className="mb-4">Solving for S, we can say that given a certain amount of the base token of the R curve, the destination tokens we get should be:</p>
            <p className="mb-4">S = S - (S<sup>1.5</sup> (R+ΔR)/R )<sup>0.66666666667</sup></p>
            <p className="mb-4">Similarly, by solving for R, it can be said that our price for a certain amount of destination tokens S is:</p>
            <p className="mb-4">R=R<sup>1.5</sup> +R(S+ΔS)<sup>1.5</sup> /S<sup>1.5</sup></p>
            <p className="mb-4">It is worth noting that both equations fail for R = 0 or S = 0. When this is true, it reverts to the base pricing formula of:</p>
            <p className="mb-4">R = c0.666667S<sup>1.5</sup></p>
            <p className="mb-4">Where c is a constant that will help to establish the slope of the initial curve and therefore the initial price.</p>
